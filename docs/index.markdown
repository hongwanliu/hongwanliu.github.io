Hi! I'm a physicist at Kavli Institute of Cosmological Physics ([KICP](https://kavlicosmo.uchicago.edu/)) at the University of Chicago and [Fermilab](https://theory.fnal.gov/). I work at the intersection of cosmology, astroparticle physics and high-energy phenomenology. I am interested in all things beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and cosmology.
