Hi! I'm a physics postdoctoral fellow at the Kavli Institute of Cosmological Physics ([KICP](https://kavlicosmo.uchicago.edu/)) at the University of Chicago, and at [Fermilab](https://theory.fnal.gov/), where I am the Schramm fellow for theoretical astrophysics.  

>*My research lies at the intersection of cosmology, astroparticle physics and high-energy physics. I work to uncover what lies beyond our currently incomplete understanding of physics.*

I enjoy thinking about how physics at the smallest scales, where new, microscopic particles may interact with each other through yet undiscovered forces, can be discovered using the physics at the largest scales, which determine the structure and evolution of our Universe. My work combines aspects of both theoretical and computational physics, all applied to finding ways of uncovering new physics in current and future experimental data.

Prior to joining KICP and Fermilab, I was jointly appointed as a postdoctoral associate at New York University's Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics ([CCPP](https://cosmo.nyu.edu)), and at [Princeton University](https://www.mariangelalisanti.com/) from 2019 -- 2023. I received my PhD in physics from MIT in 2019, and my BA in physics and mathematics from Cornell University before that. 

My CV is available [here](/images/CV_Hongwan_Liu.pdf) (updated Nov 2023).
