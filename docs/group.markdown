### Nicholas DePorzio

Nick is a theoretical physicist specialized in the field of cosmology. He is currently appointed as a Society of Fellows postdoc at Boston University, and is focused on understanding the particle nature of the Universe’s dark matter. His research emphasizes constraining the broad space of proposed theories by identifying new ways to combine diverse astronomical and particle experiment datasets. Beyond research, Nick’s newest hobby is sailing on the Charles River, and his oldest hobby is spending time with his dogs.

### Mehmet Akharman

I am a third-year undergraduate studying Astronomy and Physics at Boston University. I have worked at the BU Center for Space Physics focusing on meteor research with the MIT Millstone Hill Observatory. I am now working on BAO+BBN cosmology research under the guidance of Professor Liu. In my theoretical free time, I enjoy playing board games, reading, and exercising!
