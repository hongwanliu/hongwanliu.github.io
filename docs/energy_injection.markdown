Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics predict new particles that are present in the early Universe. These new particles may also include dark matter (DM). These new particles may decay or annihilate into high-energy, electromagnetically interacting Standard Model particles, such as electrons, positrons and photons. Other hypothetical astrophysical objects, such as primordial black holes, are also expected to emit high-energy Standard Model particles. 

As these particles travel across the Universe, they encounter the cosmic microwave background (CMB), hydrogen atoms or free electrons (which cosmologists refer to as 'baryons'), cascading into other, lower energy particles. They also deposit their energy into the CMB or the baryons. This energy deposition could manifest itself as increased ionization and heating in the baryons, or as the appearance of low-energy photons on top of the expected blackbody CMB spectrum. 

Our goal is to look for extra ionization, heating or low-energy photons that could have originated from 
such new physics processes.

Calculating how high-energy particles cascade into lower energy particles and deposit their energy into baryons can be accomplished with [**DarkHistory**](https://github.com/hongwanliu/DarkHistory).
