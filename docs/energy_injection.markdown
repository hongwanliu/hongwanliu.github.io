>*New physics processes can inject extra ionization, heating or low-energy photons, leaving striking experimental signatures in cosmological datasets.*

Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics predict new particles that are present in the early Universe. These new particles may also include dark matter (DM). They may decay or annihilate into high-energy, electromagnetically interacting Standard Model particles, such as electrons, positrons and photons. Other hypothetical astrophysical objects, such as primordial black holes, are also expected to emit high-energy Standard Model particles. 


As these particles travel across the Universe, they encounter the cosmic microwave background (CMB), hydrogen atoms or free electrons (which cosmologists refer to as 'baryons'), cascading into other, lower energy particles. They also deposit their energy into the CMB or the baryons. This energy deposition could manifest itself as increased ionization and heating in the baryons, or as the appearance of low-energy photons on top of the expected blackbody CMB spectrum. 

[Computational methods](/research/computation/) are extremely important to predicting this signal. Calculating how high-energy particles cascade into lower energy particles and deposit their energy into baryons can be accomplished with [DarkHistory](https://github.com/hongwanliu/DarkHistory) [[1--3](#bib_1)]. This code is publicly available and easy to modify.

Given an exotic source of energy injection, and its predicted contribution to ionization, heating or low-energy photons, we can now look for experimental signatures of these changes. Observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest---which is sensitive to excess heating in a redshift range of $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 5$---can be used to search for excess heating from dark matter annihilation and decay [[4](#bib_4)], as well as [dark photon](/research/dark_photons/) DM converting into low-energy photons that subsequently heat baryons [[5--7](#bib_5)].

Ionization, heating and low-energy photons can also leave a significant imprint on the [21-cm signal](/research/21cm/), an up-and-coming cosmological probe that will soon teach us a lot about the cosmic dark ages. The 21-cm global signal is extraordinarily sensitive to DM decay, and has the potential to discover DM decaying with lifetimes that are currently one or two orders of magnitude too small to detect [[8](#bib_8)]. DM processes can also have a significant impact on star formation [[9](#bib_9)], which impacts both the 21-cm global signal and power spectrum.
