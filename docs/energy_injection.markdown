Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics predict new particles that are present in the early Universe. These new particles may also include dark matter (DM). These new particles may decay or annihilate into high-energy, electromagnetically interacting Standard Model particles, such as electrons, positrons and photons. Other hypothetical astrophysical objects, such as primordial black holes, are also expected to emit high-energy Standard Model particles. 

As these particles travel across the Universe, they encounter the cosmic microwave background (CMB), hydrogen atoms or free electrons (which cosmologists refer to as 'baryons'), cascading into other, lower energy particles. They also deposit their energy into the CMB or the baryons. This energy deposition could manifest itself as increased **ionization** and **heating** in the baryons, or as the appearance of **low-energy photons** on top of the expected blackbody CMB spectrum. 

*Our goal is to look for extra ionization, heating or low-energy photons that could have originated from such new physics processes.*


## DarkHistory
[Computational methods](/research/computation/) is extremely important to this. Calculating how high-energy particles cascade into lower energy particles and deposit their energy into baryons can be accomplished with [**DarkHistory**](https://github.com/hongwanliu/DarkHistory) [[1--3](#bib_1)]. This code is publicly available and easy to modify. Out of the box, you can specify a DM model with some decay or annihilation rate into some spectrum of electrons and photons, and obtain the ionization, temperature and low-energy photon spectrum as a function of time. This can self-consistently include reionization as well.

## Experimental Signatures
Given an exotic source of energy injection, and its predicted increase ionization, heating or low-energy photons, we can now look for experimental signatures of these changes. We have shown how to use the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest---which is sensitive to excess heating in a redshift range of $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 5$---to search for dark matter annihilation and decay [[4](#bib_4)], as well as [dark photon](/research/dark_photons/) DM [[5--7](#bib_5)].

Ionization, heating and low-energy photons can also leave a significant imprint on the [21-cm signal](/research/21cm/), an up-and-coming cosmological probe that will soon teach us a lot about the cosmic dark ages. We find that the 21-cm global signal is extraordinarily sensitive to DM decay, and has the potential to discover DM decaying with lifetimes that are currently one or two orders of magnitude too small to detect [[8](#bib_8)]. DM processes can also have a significant impact on star formation [[9](#bib_9)].
